Questions and Answers
---------------------

Q: What pill images are available?
A: There are two sets of pill images in the archive - 
   1) a set of over 4000 high-quality reference pill images, that are available 
      using the RxImage API, and
   2) a set of over 133,000 consumer-grade pill images that were photographed as
      part of the project. The Word document RxImageImageLayouts.docx
      contains visual examples of the different types of images available.

Q: How do I get the pill images that are available in the RxImage API?
A: Download the rximage.zip file in this directory.  It contains > 4000 high-quality
   reference pill images, available in 6 resolutions, and associated data from the
   the RxImage API.  The zip file size is 6.9 Gigabytes, so a fast internet connection
   is recommended.

Q: How would I find a particular pill (for example a Lipitor pill)?
A: The first step would be to download a file containing the directory of images.
   For the consumer-grade images, two different formats are available
   a) directory_consumer_grade_images.xlsx - an Excel file
   b) directory_consumer_grade_images.txt - a text format file (bar "|" delimited fields)
   
   Some sample lines from the text format file
   00002322730|1|PillProjectDisc98/images/PRNJ-AXZIQ!HUQKJJBP_DV44ST0KN9.CR2|C3PI_Reference|STRATTERA 10MG
   00002322730|1|PillProjectDisc10/images/79U-YY6M1UUR6F127ZMACIWPEEXHLB.JPG|C3PI_Test|STRATTERA 10MG
 
   The fields are delimited by "|" and are described as follows:
    1 - National Drug Code (NDC) in 11 digit normalized format
    2 - part #  
    3 - location of image
    4 - image type - download RxImageImageLayouts.docx to get some visual examples of each type
    5 - name - description of drug

   You can then search the file looking for names containing Lipitor.  There are 148 images
   containing Lipitor.
   Here is one of the Lipitor records listed:

   00071015523|1|PillProjectDisc105/images/VTMV34C1TDQI4HVRHIGFDOJ9XQXI4Y.JPG|C3PI_Test|LIPITOR 10MG TABLETS

   The image for this record is located in PillProjectDisc105/images.  Navigate to this directory and
   find the image to download.

   For the reference images, an Excel file name directory_reference_images.xls
   lists the images available.  To get these images download the rximage.zip
   file.

Q: How do I get the associated data for the pills?
A: The associated data for the consumer-grade image is located in the ALLXML directory.
   There is one XML file per image directory. So, for example, if the image you retrieved
   came from PillProjectDisc105, then associated data for that image is contained in
   ALLXML/PillProjectDisc105.xml.  Note that this XML file contains associated data
   for all the images in PillProjectDisc105.

   The associated data for the reference images is contained in the rximage.zip file.

Q: How much disk space is required to download all the consumer-grade images?
A: You would need 2.6 terabytes of disk space!

Q: Will this site be updated with new images?
A: No, the project was discontinued in 2018, and there are no plans to add any new images.
